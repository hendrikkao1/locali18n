# locali18n

A lightweight i18n library for React that harnesses the browser's Web Machine Learning Translation API for instant, dynamic translations.

> **Note:** This project is in early development (v0.0.1) and relies on the experimental Web ML Translation API, which has limited browser support and requires a flag to be enabled.

## Overview

locali18n takes a new approach to web app internationalization by leveraging your browser's native translation capabilities. Unlike traditional methods locali18n delivers translations during runtime.

Traditional i18n approaches face significant challenges: translation files, templates, dynamic keys, localization processes. 

- **Truly Real-time**: Content translates instantly without deployment cycles or human translators
- **API-friendly**: Dynamic content translates automatically without needing translation keys
- **Zero Maintenance**: Eliminate the need to manage language files and translation mappings
- **User-Centered**: Adapts to individual language preferences and personal language models
